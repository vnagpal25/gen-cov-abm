# Covid-19 Proteins documentation
## Structural Proteins:

- S (spike protein): The most critical structural protein, forming the spikes on the virus surface. It is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (ACE2) and mediating fusion. It is the primary target for vaccines and most neutralizing antibodies.

- E (envelope protein): Small structural protein involved in assembly and release of new virions

- M (membrane protein): abundant structural protein, central to viral assembly

- N (nucelocapsid protein): the structural protein that binds to the viral RNA genome (forms helical structure inside virion)



ORF1a (open reading frame 1a): the first large gene region (translated to pp1a protein)

## Non-structural protein
ORF1b (Open Reading Frame 1b):This region is translated via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism at the end of ORF1a to produce the larger pp1ab polyprotein. This polyprotein is cleaved into all 16 Non-Structural Proteins (nsp1 through nsp16), including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is essential for making new viral RNA.


## Accessory proteins
- ORF3a (Open Reading Frame 3a) An accessory protein that is incorporated into the virion. It is a potential ion channel and may be involved in pathogenesis and immune evasion.

- ORF6 (Open Reading Frame 6) An accessory protein known for interfering with the host's innate immune response, particularly by blocking the interferon (IFN) pathway.

- ORF7a (Open Reading Frame 7a) An accessory protein involved in blocking host cell immune responses and regulating virion assembly and release.

- ORF7b (Open Reading Frame 7b) A small, accessory protein with a minor role in virus structure or function.

- ORF8 (Open Reading Frame 8) An accessory protein that is highly variable and often subject to deletions (like in the early B.1.1.7/Alpha variant). It is implicated in immune evasion.
- ORF9b (Open Reading Frame 9b) An accessory protein that is thought to be involved in antagonizing the host's innate immune response.


## Remaining mutations
- nuc (Nucleotide sequence) This is a special label in Nextstrain/Nextclade, and it refers to the entire genome's nucleotide sequence as a whole, rather than a specific protein-coding region. It is often used to track mutations that occur in non-coding regions (like the UTRs) or to report the overall number of mutations across the entire $\approx 30,000$ base-pair RNA genome.

Supporting evidence for the prioritized proteins

Spike (S) protein

Mutations in the spike — especially in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) — strongly influence infectivity and immune escape. For instance, the Delta and Kappa variants’ RBD mutations (e.g. L452R, T478K) were shown to enhance infectivity or alter neutralization sensitivity. 
PubMed

Variants’ spike proteins also have evolved increased membrane binding and fusion capacity, which relates directly to transmissibility.

Nucleocapsid (N) protein

There is evidence that N-protein mutations (e.g., between amino acids 199–205) modulate viral fitness by affecting the balance between replication and assembly. 
PubMed

A review on SARS-CoV-2 mutations notes that the N protein is a determinant of virulence, given its roles in genome replication, packaging, and interactions with host/viral machinery.

ORF1ab / non-structural proteins

For example, nsp13 (a helicase, part of ORF1ab region) has mutations (“A335V”) that affect its biochemical function and thereby could influence viral replication and possibly drug resistance. 
PubMed

Another nonstructural protein, Nsp9 (from ORF1ab) was shown to suppress innate immune responses (RIG-I, NF-κB, etc.), indicating that ORF1ab-derived proteins contribute to immune evasion and potentially to viral fitness.

Accessory proteins (ORF8, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a/7b, ORF9b)

ORF8: Several papers show ORF8 downregulates MHC-I, impairing antigen presentation, which helps immune evasion.

ORF8 also induces ER stress and suppresses production of IFN-β and ISGs. 
PubMed

ORF3a and ORF7a: These proteins down-regulate MHC-I by different mechanisms, helping the virus evade cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses.

More broadly, accessory proteins including ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a/7b, ORF8, and ORF9b are well documented interferon antagonists.

Membrane (M) protein

Though often more conserved, M mutations can still impact spike function: the M protein was shown to inhibit furin cleavage of spike by interacting with furin, and to reduce spike surface localization — which may affect fusion and transmissibility.
